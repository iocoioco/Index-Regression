Yes! If we simplify and classify program tricks, the number of tricks cannot be very large. 🚀 AI trading programs operate based on a limited set of core strategies because their goal is to maximize efficiency while minimizing risk.

By understanding these core patterns, you can predict program behavior more easily and react faster. Instead of trying to analyze every tick, focus on the few key tricks that programs use repeatedly.

🔍 Simplified Classification of AI Program Tricks
There are only a few fundamental tricks, but they have many variations. Here’s how we can classify them:

1️⃣ Manipulating Market Sentiment
(Goal: Trick retail traders into reacting emotionally)

🔹 Fake Buying / Selling (Spoofing & Baiting)

The program places big fake orders to create an illusion of strong buying or selling pressure.
As soon as traders react, the orders disappear, and the program takes the opposite position.
🔹 Stop-Loss Hunting (Flush & Trap)

The program pushes the price slightly below key levels (support or stop-loss areas).
This forces retail traders to panic sell, and then the program buys everything at a discount.
🔹 Fake Breakouts / Breakdowns (Bull & Bear Traps)

The program pushes the price slightly above resistance to trigger buy orders.
Then, it quickly reverses and dumps, trapping retail traders.
✅ How to Counter It:

Don’t place stop-losses at obvious round numbers.
Wait for real volume confirmation before entering a breakout.
2️⃣ Controlling Liquidity & Price Movement
(Goal: Absorb orders efficiently without revealing true intentions)

🔹 Iceberg Orders (Hidden Accumulation or Distribution)

The program places small visible orders but executes much larger hidden orders.
This prevents traders from noticing large buying or selling pressure.
🔹 Ping-Pong Trading (Fake Volume Creation)

The program buys and sells between its own accounts to generate volume without real movement.
This tricks traders into thinking the stock is active when it’s actually being controlled.
🔹 Slow Accumulation / Slow Distribution (Stealth Moves)

Instead of buying everything at once, the program slowly absorbs shares over time to avoid price spikes.
If selling, it distributes shares over multiple days to avoid crashing the stock.
✅ How to Counter It:

Check if real volume is increasing or just fake transactions.
Look for signs of hidden orders (price not moving despite high volume).
3️⃣ Creating Forced Reactions from Traders
(Goal: Make retail traders buy high and sell low)

🔹 Gap & Fade (Trap in Pre-Market or Market Open)

The stock gaps up at open, attracting traders.
The program then sells into strength, causing a slow decline.
🔹 Pump & Dump (Artificial Momentum)

The program aggressively buys to push the price up, forcing FOMO traders to enter.
Then, it dumps the stock at a high, causing a crash.
🔹 Reversal Trap (Quick Flip After a Fake Move)

The program pushes the price sharply in one direction to trigger stop-losses.
Then, it immediately reverses in the opposite direction, catching traders off guard.
✅ How to Counter It:

Be cautious of sudden sharp moves without news.
Don’t chase gaps or breakouts unless supported by strong volume.
📌 Conclusion: Only a Few Core Tricks
All AI program tricks fall into three major categories: 1️⃣ Manipulating Sentiment (Fake buying, stop-loss hunting, false breakouts)
2️⃣ Controlling Liquidity (Hidden orders, fake volume, slow accumulation)
3️⃣ Forcing Trader Reactions (Pump & dump, reversal traps, pre-market gaps)

There may be different variations of these tricks, but the core patterns are always the same. Once you recognize them in real-time, you can avoid getting trapped and even use them to your advantage.

🔥 Now that you’ve simplified the tricks, do you feel more confident in predicting program moves? 😃🚀
