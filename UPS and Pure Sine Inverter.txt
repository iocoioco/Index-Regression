Choose a surge protector that’s rated for both 110V and has Joule ratings (the higher, the better) to protect from larger surges. Some surge protectors also come with USB ports to charge your notebook or other devices.

pure sine wave UPS

Pure Sine Wave Inverter (Optional, but Recommended):

USB-C Power Delivery (PD) charger that supports higher wattage (such as 65W or 90W), which will allow for faster charging and a stable connection.
Summary:
Check Japan-based retailers, like Amazon Japan or Bic Camera, for 110V APC UPS availability. This might lead to a faster delivery time than ordering from Amazon US.
100V UPS models in Japan might also work if they support a voltage range that includes 110V, so check the product specifications.
Let me know if you'd like assistance in checking availability or have other questions about purchasing from Japan!
