11,000 BTU air conditioner typically consumes around 900 to 1,100 watts
Fridge: A small 12V refrigerator (around 50-70 watts) could run for 30-40 hours




Alternator Charging: 100-150 watts

Solar Charging: 200-watt system could generate about 1 kWh per day.
	To generate 4 kWh per day, you would need around 1,000 watts (1 kW) of solar panels under good sunlight conditions 
generator connected to the car's engine 
	100amps×12volts=1,200watts=1.2kW
	150amps×12volts=1,800watts=1.8kW
	2,000-watt 4 kWh per day if run for 2 hours at full load.1 to 2 gallons of fuel
	
EU22i : 48-57 dB 2000watts weight 46.7LB
	Fuel Consumption: Around 0.95 gallons of gasoline will last for up to 8.1 hours at a 25% load (about 450 watts). This results in approximately 0.11 gallons per hour at low load.
	Efficiency: Excellent fuel efficiency when running at lower or moderate loads, which makes it highly efficient for tasks requiring less power (like camping or light RV use).
	The Honda EU2200i is an inverter generator, which makes it more efficient for low to medium power needs. It can throttle down the engine to save fuel when less power is required.

Cummins Onan 2500 LP propane generator 

Camping Site : 6A hookup will give you about 1.38 kW (230V × 6A), while a 16A hookup will provide 3.68 kW (230V × 16A) of power.
