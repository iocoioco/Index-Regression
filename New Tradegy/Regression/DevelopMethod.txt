✅ Finalized Procedure for Building Linear Regression Data (Index Movement vs. Multiples):
Initial Setup
Define constituent stock list:
Use 50 KOSPI or KOSDAQ stocks with their normalized weights (sum = 1.0).

Set root directory:
Data directories are located at @"C:\병신\분\".

Get and reverse-sort directories:
Most recent date should be first (descending order).

For Each Directory (Date)
Check "삼성전자" minute file:
If row count < 300 → skip this date (not enough trading data).

Identify available stocks:
Among the 50 stock list, build a list of stocks that exist in the current directory.
If fewer than 35 stocks found → skip this date.

Load stock data:
Read 6-digit HHmmss data of existing stocks and index ETF file.

Loop over time (minute-wise)
Check index time interval:
For each row i and i-1 in index ETF file, compare time difference in seconds using full 6-digit time.
Accept only if 50 < Δt < 70 seconds.

Get price change:

From t_prev to t_now (e.g., 085959 → 090058).

Use rounded times to 4-digit (HHmm) like 0859 and 0900 to record Δprice.

Calculate Factor Values
For each stock at time t_now (e.g., 090058):

Check the same 6-digit time exists.

Validate stock time interval (Δt < 90 seconds as well).

Read:

Buy multiple (col 8)

Sell multiple (col 9)

Calculate:

diff = buy - sell

sum = buy + sell

Multiply by weight:
For each stock:

weighted_diff += diff * weight

weighted_sum += sum * weight

total_weight += weight

Accept or discard:

If total_weight < 0.8, discard the row.

Else:

Normalize:

final_diff = weighted_diff / total_weight

final_sum = weighted_sum / total_weight

Record one data row:

(Δprice, final_diff, final_sum)
