my work flows 
1. download 1000 stock data from stock exchange company every second using API 
2. recalculate the date for my own purpose 
3. plot using chart and datagridview to make a selection and a decision  
4 buying based on the decision 
5 monitoring the price change of holding stock 
6 sell ... recommend code structure how to start


 I used a lot of global variables to used in different classes ... 
 how can I change my codes ... guess total lines are more than 20,000 lines

 public class StockRepository
{
    public Dictionary<string, decimal> StockPrices { get; private set; }

    public StockRepository()
    {
        StockPrices = new Dictionary<string, decimal>();
    }

    public void AddStockPrice(string symbol, decimal price)
    {
        StockPrices[symbol] = price;
    }

    public decimal GetStockPrice(string symbol)
    {
        return StockPrices.ContainsKey(symbol) ? StockPrices[symbol] : 0;
    }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var stockRepository = new StockRepository();

        // Add some sample data
        stockRepository.AddStockPrice("AAPL", 150.25M);
        stockRepository.AddStockPrice("GOOGL", 2800.50M);

        var stockAnalyzer = new StockAnalyzer(stockRepository);
        var stockDisplay = new StockDisplay(stockRepository);

        stockAnalyzer.Analyze();
        stockDisplay.Display();
    }
}
